# **This project will demonstrate my knowledge of:**
- **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, event handling, and API calls).
- **Fetch API** (or Axios) to handle external API requests.
- **Error handling** in API responses.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** (async/await or promises).
- **Basic web development skills** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

---

# 🚀 **Core Features**

1. **Text Input**: User enters text in a field.
2. **API Call**: Fetch request is sent to a text-to-image generation API.
3. **Image Display**: The generated image is shown on the webpage.
4. **Loading/Error Handling**: Displays loading spinner and error messages if needed.

---

# ⚙️ **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: Page structure.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: DOM interaction, async/await, Fetch API.
- **DALL·E API (or alternatives)**: To generate images.

# 💡 **Tips from the Developer**

This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to explore API integration with JavaScript. The simplicity of the code structure makes it easy for beginners, yet it's versatile enough to be expanded into more complex applications. 🎯

If you’re trying this on your own, here’s my advice:

- **Start small**: Get comfortable with API calls, then move on to more advanced topics like error handling and UI enhancements.
- **Experiment**: Try using different APIs or adding new features like image filters or sharing options!
